			The Mark 13 Missile Launcher is a single-arm, ship-mounted guided missile launcher. It is capable of firing RIM-66 Standard and RIM-24 Tartar missiles for anti-air defense and the RGM-84 Harpoon missile for anti-ship purposes. Below the launcher itself lies a 40 round magazine. Although it has since been removed from the US Navy’s arsenal, it still sees service in several other countries and on old donated US warships.

		<p>
			This model is built upon the rotation base, the arm can elevate up and down, and comes with a RIM-66 Standard missile. Where you might put this build, we have no clue, unless you have a 1:35 scale Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate lying around.
