			The M-2-4 Rocket Truck was a weapon system utilizing multiple rocket launchers built upon International Harvester’s M-2-4 One-Ton Truck. Each truck could hold up to three launchers, with each launcher loaded with 12 rockets. The M-2-4 Rocket Truck was used by the US Marine Corps, and saw service in multiple battles across the Pacific, including Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. They found ideal conditions on Iwo Jima, where the hilly terrain prevented conventional artillery from reaching Japanese positions located on reverse-slopes. The rocket trucks were well liked by the infantry for their ability to lay down large quantities of explosives quickly, but the dust cloud kicked up by rocket launches was an easy and lucrative target for counter-battery fire. Crews quickly learned to fire and then disengage with haste.

			This model features an folding rear gate, a folding windshield, four rolling wheels (wow!), and is able to fit six rockets. If you just want the M-2-4 truck, which the US Navy and Marines used as troop-transport and utility vehicles, just take the rocket battery off the back.
