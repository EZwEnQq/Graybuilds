			The Petit Véhicule Protégé (Small Protected Vehicle) is a lightweight vehicle used mainly by the French Army. Rated at STANAG 4569 level 2 protection, it is capable of protecting against small arms fire and anti-personnel mines. The PVP is able to mount several different weapon systems, from LMGs to the MMP anti-tank missile launcher. It serves many different roles, and even with its small size, has the capacity to fit up to 7 passengers inside.
