			The UH-1N Twin Huey is a medium utility helicopter. It was developed from the UH-1 Iroquois, with the main difference being the change from one engine to two engines (hence the name, “Twin Huey”). It has seen service in Vietnam and Operation Iraqi Freedom in the United States Marine Corps, but has since been replaced by the UH-1Y Venom. The Twin Huey is currently being used by the United States Air Force to guard ICBM sites and provide emergency support in Washington DC, but will be replaced within the next few years by the MH-139.

			This model features poseable doors, a FLIR below the cockpit, spinning rotors on top and on the tail, and room for two pilots along with passengers or cargo. It is based off of the version used by the USAF.
