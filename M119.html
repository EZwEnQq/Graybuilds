			The M119 Light Howitzer is a lightweight 105mm howitzer used by the United States Army. Based off of the British L118 Light Gun, it was produced under licence from 1989-2013. It has a standard crew of 7 and has been used in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The M119 is lauded for its high rate of fire, along with its ability to pack such a large punch in a relatively small and light package, making it an effective gun for airborne units. It is often towed by the Humvee, carried on the underside of Blackhawk and Chinook transport helicopters, or air dropped by parachute.

			This model features a traversing gun, a hitch to connect to vehicles, and two rolling wheels (wow!). The main gun itself can rotate and fold down just like the real howitzer, and the firing platform can be detached and placed on the trail for transport mode.
