			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>
				Hello, and thank you for visiting GrayBuilds! We are a team of two long time LEGO® enthusiasts that also have a knack for learning about military history and vehicles. In the summer of 2020, we brainstormed an idea for a LEGO® instructions sharing platform and then worked to make it a reality. Would it have been easier to just put our instructions on an existing instructions site? Probably, but we wanted something we could call our own and customize, focused on military builds. The website is very much a work in progress, and we will continue to add features and builds for the foreseeable future, so please check back often! 
			</p>
			<h3>So why are the instructions free?</h3>
			<p>
				Since we (unfortunately) do not own mounds of LEGO® bricks, all of our builds are modeled digitally. As a result, our instructions are not of the same standard as those produced by established LEGO® military-building businesses. Most companies build their models out of solid LEGO® first. However, we are only able to model our builds digitally. This may mean a few stability issues or problems that cannot be seen on a digital model. However, every build has a lot of time and effort put into making sure that they are stable and that the pieces used are relatively affordable. 
			</p>
			<h3>What kind of builds do you make and why?</h3>
			<p>
				We primarily do modern and Cold War builds, with a handful of WWII builds. We also set out with the objective of building vehicles that have not been done by other companies. As a result, you will not see us making an M1 Abrams or a Humvee or a Blackhawk helicopter, even if they are some of the most common/famous modern vehicles. We have no intention of undermining other businesses that rely on their instructions and kits for income, so we choose to make instructions on vehicles that are not so well-known.
			</p>
			<h3>Do you do commissions?</h3>
			<p>
				While we do not do commissions, ideas and suggestions are always appreciated. Please keep in mind that we are not a service and that we mainly do modern and Cold War builds. Also, suggestions for vehicles done by other companies already will not be considered.
